version 0x0100 - released on 20 april 2010
	- Initial working version of the program
	- Source code created by dimitar, minor edits and bugfixes by sasho.
	- Added support for standalone UART mode since prerelease version. It is not identical to the CDC mode
	  because it only supports one direction (TX) communication with host at
	  57600-8-N-1 configuration. Configuration of parameters of the device is only possible
	  through the CDC mode.
